## Grammar: Simple past with the verb be and other verbs
We use the simple past with the verb BE to talk about how things were before.

Examples:
* I was young when we moved.
* She was a very good student at school.
* He was very quite when he was a kid.
* Was it too difficult?
* You were very good students at school.

Structure:
* Subject + verb BE + complement
* Subject + verb BE + NOT + complement
* Verb BE + subject + complement + ?

For other verbs the simple past is formed by adding -**ed** at the end of the verb.

Examples:
* We **moved** to Canada when I was 5.
* I **accepted** the job and I **moved** to Mexico.
* She **didn't** work there for so long

There are some verbs that change. Irregular verbs.
* She **spoke** English and Portuguese.
